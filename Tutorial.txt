Please note: You must compile before attempting to use the GUI or the terminal functionality.

***********
* Compile *
*********** 
	Step 1). Launch a terminal and navigate to the "AutoPC" folder
	
	Step 2). Execute the command:
		cmake .

	Step 3). Execute the command:
		make
	
	Note: These commands may require superuser privelages to run. If this is the case try using (For Mac OSX and Ubuntu):
		sudo cmake .
		sudo make

*******
* GUI *
*******
To succesfully create and visualize a point cloud using our GUI, please follow the steps in the order they are laid out

	Step 1). Launch a terminal and navigate to the "AutoPC" folder
	
	Step 2). Launch the GUI by typing into the terminal:
		python3 GUI.py
	
	*OPTIONAL*
		There are included examples that are meant to show off the funcitonality of our project.
		If you would like to view these examples simply click the button on the GUI:
			-Sample # (where # is whichever sample you would like to view)

-Creating the Disparity Image
	Step 3). Left click on the "Upload Left Image" button to select your left image.

	Step 4). Left click on the "Upload Right Image" button to select your right image.
		Note: The images from step 3 and 4 must be a rectified stereo pair.

	Step 5). Click the "Disparity" button to create the disparity image.

		Note: If you would like to use the included samples, when uploading either image, 
			navigate to "AutoPC/samples" and select the image you would like to use.
			When selected the other image, be sure you select the correct pair.
		Example: 
			-Left Image: AutoPC/samples/I1_000055.pgm
			-Right Image: AutoPC/samples/I2_000055.pgm

-Creating the Point Cloud
	Please note: Our GUI will select the correct disparity image to be used when creating the point cloud

	Step 6). Enter into the "Focal Length" text field the number that corresponds to the Focal Length of the camera that was used to take the stereo pair images.
	
	Step 7). Enter into the "Principle X" text field the number that corresponds to the Principle Point X component of the camera that was used to take the stereo pair images.

	Step 8). Enter into the "Principle Y" text field the number that corresponds to the Principle Point Y component of the camera that was used to take the stereo pair images.

	Step 9). Enter into the "Baseline" text field the number that corresponds to the Baseline of the camera that was used to take the stereo pair images.

	Step 10). Click the "Point Cloud" button to create the point cloud

-Visualising the point cloud
	Step 11). Click the "Visualize" button to visualize the point cloud

Note: After successfully creating the Point cloud, the point cloud will be saved in the AutoPC folder as "point_cloud.pcd". 

*********************
* Run from Terminal *
*********************
	Step 1). Launch terminal and navigate to the "AutoPC" folder

-Creating a Disparity Image:
	To create a disparity image simply type into terminal
		./library disparity path/of/leftImage path/of/rightImage

	where path/of/leftImage and path/of/rightImage are replaced with the path to the and left and right images of the stero pair 
		that you would like to create a disparity image from.
	
	Note: Your dispairty images will be saved under path/of/leftImage_disp.pgm and path/of/rightImage_disp.pgm

-Creating a Point Cloud:
	To create a point cloud simply type into terminal
		./library populate path/of/imageFromStereoPair path/of/correspondingDisparity focalLength baseline principleX principleY

		where
			-path/of/imageFromSteroPair is the path to a single image of a stero pair (left or right)
			-path/of/correspondingDispairty is the path to the Disparity image corresponding to the image you chose from the stereo pair
			-focalLength is the focal length of the camera used to take the stereo pair images
			-baseline is the baseline of the camera used to take the stereo pair images
			-principleX is the principle point x component of the camera used to take the stero pair images
			-principleY is the principle point y component of the camera used to take the stero pair images

	Note: By default, your point cloud will be saved as "point_cloud.pcd" in the "AutoPC" folder.

-Visualing a Point Cloud:
	To visualize a point cloud simple type into terminal
		./library visualize path/to/point_cloud

	where path/to/point_cloud is the path to the point cloud that you would like to visualize.
